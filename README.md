# üöó Autiƒá Parkiƒá Application

The application must ensure real-time sync with multiple client instances, displaying consistent elapsed time for rides in RUNNING status across all clients. This demands a real-time communication mechanism between the server and all connected clients to maintain a consistent state.

## Application Workflow

Users can register a vehicle, which has a distinct name in the database and an associated image
stored on **AWS S3**. Once a vehicle is registered, rides can be initiated. It's important
to note that a vehicle can only be engaged in a single ride at a given time. Rides transition
through several distinct statuses: _CREATED_, _RUNNING_, _PAUSED_, _STOPPED_, and _FINISHED_. Initially,
a ride is in the _CREATED_ state. Once _RUNNING_, it can either be _PAUSED_ or _STOPPED_. When a ride is
_PAUSED_, it can be resumed by returning to the _RUNNING_ state. Conversely, a _STOPPED_ ride offers
two choices: it can either restart or advance to its _FINISHED_ state. Opting to restart concludes
the current ride and launches a new one using the same vehicle. Once designated as _FINISHED_, a
ride's status is fixed and unalterable. A key function is the real-time tabulation and distribution
of the elapsed ride time once it's _RUNNING_. This time calculation disregards any _PAUSED_ intervals.
To facilitate this, the database stores arrays of _started_at_ and _paused_at_ timestamps. The computed
elapsed time is then shared in real-time to all connected clients using the **STOMP WebSocket**
protocol. Considering the application's need to relay elapsed time updates every second, ongoing
rides are temporarily cached in system memory (_RAM_) using `Collections.synchronizedList`. This
strategy helps avoid recurrent database queries. Given the cap of 20 active rides at any
instance, there's no compelling reason to employ comprehensive distributed caching systems like
Redis or memcached.
